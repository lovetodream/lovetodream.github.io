# Personal Website

This is the code for my personal website.

It is a SvelteKit App.

## Developing

Once you've cloned the project you can start a development server:

```bash
# first time only
npm install

npm run dev
```

## Building

To create a production version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

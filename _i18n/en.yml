  title: Background
  leading: I am currently working as a Freelancer building things for the Web, either alone or together with others. I've learned the biggest part of my knowledge by myself. At the moment I am working on a few <a class="underline-link" href="https://opensource.org" target="_blank">Open-Source</a> projects on <a class="underline-link" href="https://github.com/TimoZacherl" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
  middle: As a Software Engineer, it is really important to close the gap between user-friendly design and reliable software &mdash; I combine my technical knowledge and my sense of great design to create a stunning product. My goal is to build applications that are scalable and efficient under the hood while providing engaging, pixel-perfect user experiences.
  trailing: <strong>When I'm not in front of my computer</strong>, I'm probably riding my mountain bike or cruising around on my penny board.
